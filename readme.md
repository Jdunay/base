# Base.js

A powerful MVC framework for people who want the ultimate elegance, simplicity, and efficiency without compromise.

Inspired by the JS framework titans, Base is an initiative to consolidate the benefits of them all,
into a flexible, efficiency, and ultra high performance foundation for building
lightning fast yet amazingly powerful HTML5 applications that are as beatiful to code as they are to behold.

Base takes the very best of Backbone.js (bulletproof ORM, microscopic footprint, extensible architecture), best of
Ember.js (hierarchical view management, intuitive templating, best in class performance and scalability), best of
Angular.js ('magic' updating templates, dead-simple web components, powerful event propagation and broadcasting),
and assembles it all together under one framework with an ultra efficient, lightweight core, a powerful plugin-based architecture,
and much more! Hot dayamn
