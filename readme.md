# Base.js

A simple, sexy, and extensible MVC framework built on top of Backbone and Ractive.

Built in is the best of Backbone.js (lightweight, high performance, bulletproof ORM), best of
Ember.js (hierarchical view management, application level logic, powerful helper classes), best of
Angular.js (web components, model driven views, DOM-like event bubbling and broadcasting), plus
a composite, plugin-based architecture, powerful state management and much more!
