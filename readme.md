# Base.js

A powerful MVC framework for people who want the ultimate elegance, simplicity, and efficiency without compromise.

Inspired by the JS framework titans, Base is an initiative to consolidate the benefits of them all,
into a flexible, efficiency, and ultra high performance foundation for building
lightning fast yet amazingly powerful HTML5 applications that are as beatiful to code as they are to behold.

Base takes the very best of Backbone.js (bulletproof ORM, microscopic footprint, extensible architecture), best of
Ember.js (hierarchical view management, intuitive templating, best in class performance and scalability), best of
Angular.js ('magic' updating templates, dead-simple web components, powerful event propagation and broadcasting),
and assembles it all together under one framework with an ultra efficient, lightweight core, a powerful plugin-based architecture,
and much more!

That, and, of course, seeking to resolve the inherent issues and limitations plaguing each framework. Such as
Backbone's lack of support for nested views, models, collections, dynamic templates, and other critical features
supported by larger frameworks,
Ember's bloat (235kb minified - yikes!), overcomplexity, overuse of redundant, unnecessary helper classes
(renderbuffer, defaultresolver, enumerable, etc), and severely limited template binding, and
Angular's performance and scaling issues regarding their use of 'dirty' model checking,
lack of extensibility via diverting the classical inheritance model (i.e. no plugins or subclassing), and lack of robust and restful ORM management.

Hot dayamn.

Built on top of Backbone, jQuery, and Ractive, Base.js is the attempt to have everything
and leave nothing for a brighter world of elegant, scalable, high performance HTML5 apps
that are effortless, intuitive, and even fun to create, debug, test, and maintain.
