# Base.js

A powerful MVC framework for people who want the ultimate in elegance, simplicity, and efficiency without compromise.

Inspired by the JS framework titans, Base is an initiative to accumulate the benefits of them all,
without sacrifice, and with elegance, efficiency, and performance as its highest values.
Base takes the very best of Backbone.js (bulletproof ORM, microscopic footprint, ultra high performance), best of
Ember.js (hierarchical view management, powerful state management, dynamic attribute binding), best of
Angular.js (web components, 'magic' auto-updatinng templates, DOM-like event bubbling and broadcasting),
and assembles it all together with an ultra efficient, lightweight core, a powerful plugin-based architecture,
and much more! Hot dayamn
